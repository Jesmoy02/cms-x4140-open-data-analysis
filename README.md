Search for the χc1(4140) in B⁺→J/ψφK⁺ decays using CMS Run 2011A MuOnia Open Data.
This repository contains the analysis workflow developed to study CMS Run 2011A MuOnia open data in a search for the χc1(4140) candidate in B⁺→J/ψφK⁺ decays. It comprises the main steps of the analysis, including event selection, reconstruction of intermediate states, and exploration of the B⁺ mass spectrum and the J/ψφ invariant mass distribution.
